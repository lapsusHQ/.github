## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>From childhood's hour I have not been</p>
<p>As others were -- I have not seen</p>
<p>As others saw -- I could not bring</p>
<p>My passions from a common spring --</p>
<p>From the same source I have not taken</p>
<p>My sorrow -- I could not awaken</p>
<p>My heart to joy at the same tone --</p>
<p>And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --</p>
<p>Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn</p>
<p>Of a most stormy life -- was drawn</p>
<p>From ev'ry depth of good and ill</p>
<p>The mystery which binds me still --</p>
<p>From the torrent, or the fountain --</p>
<p>From the red cliff of the mountain --</p>
<p>From the sun that 'round me roll'd</p>
<p>In its autumn tint of gold --</p>
<p>From the lightning in the sky</p>
<p>As it pass'd me flying by --</p>
<p>From the thunder, and the storm --</p>
<p>And the cloud that took the form</p>
<p>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</p>
<p>Of a demon in my view --</p>

> by Edgar Allan Poe (published 1875)
